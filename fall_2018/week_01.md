## Last Week's Accomplishments
* I learned about Vue.js and read through the javascript files for the frontend.
* I read through the go files and learned about how data moves around
* I learned how to make basic web servers with go

## This Week's Plan
* think about making a model using the historical data, the schedule, and shuttles location
* read through docs
* parse pdf

## Anything Blocking?
How do I gather 1 week of data (I found out that there is 1 month of data in the db and where to find it)  
How can we best display the times info to people (that's a frontend problem)
